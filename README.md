## Project Overview
This project analyzes online retail data to understand customer purchasing behavior, top revenue-generating products, and seasonal sales trends. The analysis provides insights to help businesses improve marketing, inventory management, and customer retention strategies.

## Objectives
- Identify top-performing products and countries by total revenue  
- Understand customer purchase frequency and order patterns  
- Detect seasonal and time-based sales trends  
- Generate actionable insights for marketing and customer retention

## Dataset
- Source: UK Online Retail Dataset (commonly available on Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository)  
- Key Columns: InvoiceNo, StockCode, Description, Quantity, InvoiceDate, UnitPrice, CustomerID, Country

## Tools and Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading and cleaning (removing missing values, duplicates, invalid transactions)  
2. Feature engineering (calculating total revenue, extracting time features)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Visualization of top countries, top products, and customer segments  
5. Monthly and hourly sales trend analysis  
6. Business insights and recommendations  

## Key Insights
- The United Kingdom generates the majority of total revenue.  
- A few high-value customers contribute disproportionately to total sales.  
- Top-selling items include home decor and gift products such as the “WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER.”  
- Strong sales peaks occur in November–December, aligning with the holiday season.  
- Most transactions involve small quantities, but a few large orders drive major revenue spikes.

## Business Recommendations
- Prioritize promotions and inventory for top-selling products during holiday months.  
- Develop loyalty programs for high-value repeat customers.  
- Consider cross-sell and bundling strategies to increase average order value.  
- Analyze non-UK customers separately to explore international opportunities.
